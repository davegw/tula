        My name is Daryl Wong. In this prospectus I will articulate my investment principles and how they compare with other investment funds. I will share some of my fundamental investment strategies (value, creative research, and contrarian) and provide some past examples of each type of investment. I will also give a brief history of my investments and how I have been able to opportunistically take advantage of the market. Finally, we’ll take a look at how I structure my investments to make sure our interests are properly aligned on maximizing return and minimizing risk. I hope this prospectus gives you a good understanding for my investment style and the principles I employ when investing for my clients.

        I have been investing in the stock market since 1995. My average annual return over the last 19 years is 15.8% while the S&P 500 average is 10.7%. My investment style is a combination of value investing, contrarian and creatively finding the next trend before it happens. I invest for the long run and tend to buy and hold for many years. I try to take a simple approach. I avoid the exotic investment. I do not short. I do not trade puts and calls, nor futures or swaps. I do not buy on margin. I invest my clients’ money the way I invest my own. I try to make returns that beat the market while also trying to minimize risk.

        As John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard Group, wisely stated, “To earn consistently high returns you should invest with simplicity. Rely on ordinary virtues such as common sense, thrift, realistic expectations, patience and perseverance. Call them ‘character.’ And in investing, over the long run, character will be rewarded.”

          I tend to invest more heavily in small cap stocks than most investment managers. I find that investing in attractively valued under-the-radar small cap stocks have excellent growth potential. They are also more likely to be acquisition targets for larger companies. My best years have been when this has happened. Already this year I have had seven companies that are being acquired or being taken private. This has resulted in daily gains of 20% to 115% for each of these acquired companies.
        %p.prospectus_body
          Although I have a better chance to make outsized gain with small caps, I also buy some larger more established companies to help keep the portfolio from becoming too volatile. To balance their volatility, I do invest in some larger, more mainstream companies such as Pfizer and Walmart. These companies are very stable and provide consistent and solid returns.

          An example of creatively finding the next trend is gun stocks. With all the heart breaking news connected with the sad shootings in Columbine, Aurora, Virginia Tech, Newtown, Connecticut and many more, there has been a cry for more stringent gun control. This has caused gun stocks to soar because people who are thinking about buying a gun are doing it now. It was also a bet that Obama would win the election last November. If the Republican candidates had won, there would not be such a push for gun control which ironically would have been bad for gun stocks. The gun stocks which I invested in (Strum Ruger and Smith & Wesson) gained more than 300% over the last five years. By the way, I do not own any guns and I am not a gun enthusiast. But I am an enthusiast of making a profit!

          Another example of creative research investing is social media in China. We all know about the explosive growth in the number of users for American social media companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. But what about social media in other countries? In China there is an internet company called Sina. Sina owns Weibo.com, which is like the Twitter of China. As popular as social media is in the United States, it is even more important to the Chinese people. Because of their government’s history of censuring the news, Weibo is a way for them to have a voice and be heard. At the end of 2012 Weibo had 500 million registered accounts. To put that number into perspective, that is 200 million more accounts than the population of the United States! 2012 revenue from Weibo was $66 million. 2013 is projected to be $300 million and 2014 is projected to be $550 million. Sina’s stock is up 59% for the first 8 months of 2013.

          An example of a contrarian investment would be Bank of America. Nobody wanted to touch this company in 2011 and the price did fall a lot during that year. Despite the continued decline in the price of Bank of America I purchased shares in January, June and September of 2011 as well as February of 2012. In 2012 Bank of America came roaring back, more than doubling its value and now I am in a gain position. The price fell so far that it seemed like the only way it would not make a great investment is if it went out of business and it’s just too big to do that. If the government would not let AIG go out of business during the mortgage meltdown of 2007 to 2009 than I reasoned that B of A would also survive and in the long run prosper. I have large holdings of B of A and I could easily see holding them for ten years. During the next ten years I see B of A putting their mortgage problems behind them and the price going back to pre-mortgage meltdown prices. If I am correct, that would mean a quadrupling of its current price. Obviously B of A is not a small cap company but I felt that it was oversold and the contrarian investor in me saw this as a good opportunity.

          To quote Ben Graham from the frontispiece to Security Analysis: “Many shall be restored that are now fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor.” That is a nice summation of contrarian investing.

          These were the go-go years when high tech stocks really took off. These were some of the markets best years ever. From 1995 (when I started investing), my performance equaled or exceeded the market in five out of seven years. The S&P 500 averaged 17.4% over those seven years while I averaged 25.7% gains for the same period. Cisco Systems and Ventana Medical Systems were two of my stars.

        %p.prospectus_body
          The dot-com bubble burst and the S&P 500 lost 22% in 2002. I lost a comparable 25% as well. Some of my biggest losers were GE, which dropped 40% during the year. I also gave back some of my earlier Cisco gains as it fell 33% as well. But the Cisco story lives on as I bought it again in early 2012 and as of September 2013 it is up over 45%. After all these years, it’s become more of a value company than a growth company and even pays a dividend!

          The market rebounded quickly from the Dot-Com crash. Over this 5 year period the S&P 500 gained an average of 13.2% while TULA continued to outperform the market gaining an average of 17.8% over the same period.

        %p.prospectus_body
          As mentioned earlier, over the last 19 years I have averaged a 15.8% annual return on investment. I believe that actually understates my performance and these are the reasons. During the stock meltdown of 2008 the investors that did the best were the ones that held on to their stocks. Unfortunately and understandably, many investors panicked and sold their stocks. By doing so they missed out on the 2009 and 2010 rebound. Not only did I not sell stocks at that time, I gritted my teeth and bought more stocks at the end of 2008. The market continued to tumble so I held my breath and continued to buy in early 2009. My thoughts were that the market was very much oversold and that stocks were grossly undervalued. In March 2009, the market hit bottom. Because I had bought stocks when they were near the bottom, I completely recovered all my losses by the second quarter of 2010. Everything after that has been gravy. Only now, six years later has the market rebounded to its pre-crash highs. The 2008 mortgage market meltdown was actually good for me. It allowed me to opportunistically buy stocks at good values and my historical average annual return understates my performance because I was more fully invested during the 2009 and 2010 bounce back years.

          2011 was a bit of a stumble for me. The market registered a small gain, but I took a loss of 14% on the year. One of my larger holdings, Legg Mason (LM) fell 20% during the year. To add to the 2011 loss I increased holdings during the year by 50%. There was a management shake up the next year and a new CEO was put in charge. While an underperformer in 2011, Legg Mason is shaping up to have a happy ending as it has gained 32% over the first 9 months of 2013 (which is even better since I bought those extra shares at low prices in 2011). 2012 saw continued recovery as the market and TULA both made similarly strong gains.
        %p.prospectus_body
          2013 is shaping up to be one of my best years ever. I’ll call it the year of the acquisition. As mentioned previously, I’ve had seven companies bought out this year. Since we had been in a recession, companies had not spent much money and consequently, many are now cash rich. As we emerge out of the recession now, this is a perfect environment for mergers and acquisitions. I am not surprised by this activity, but still am very pleased to have had seven successful acquisitions in my portfolio on the year.
    - render_prospectus_section 'FEE STRUCTURE', 'fee-structure' do
      %p.prospectus_body
        The market rate for fees that most investment fund managers charge is 1% to 2% of assets managed plus 20% of gains in excess of 5-7%. I charge 1.25% of assets managed plus 10% of all gains. By charging 10% instead of 20% and not having a threshold to make a 20% bonus I have removed some conflict of interest to shoot for the moon without consideration for safety. I will gradually invest your money over time. I will not let the bonus cause me to quickly dump your money into the market all at once just so I can have a better chance of making more money for myself. Many hedge funds try to hit home runs by making risky or levered investments. They have incentive to do so because they often charge 20% of the gain above a certain threshold. There is a conflict of interest there. Without the 20% “carry” the hedge fund manager might rightly choose to be more conservative. I don’t see them investing in good, solid stocks that provide a stable if unspectacular return with virtually no volatility. That’s because there is no chance to make a big killing there. I have no problem investing some money in safer, more reliable stocks while I’m trying to make a bigger return in other areas. I will manage your investments the same way I manage mine. If anything, I will be more careful with your investments as I feel a great responsibility to take good care of your money. TD Ameritrade is my broker and they insure each account for up to $500 million.
    - render_prospectus_section 'CONCLUSION', 'conclusion' do
      %p.prospectus_body
        I have over 19 years of investment experience with an excellent and proven track record of delivering 15.8% average annual returns to my clients. My investment principles are to choose simple, understandable investments over complex or exotic ones. I tend to buy and hold for many years, emphasizing the long term over the short term. My investment strategies are three-fold: Firstly, to buy undervalued stocks, particularly small caps which not only show more growth potential, but may also become acquisition targets. Secondly, creatively research the market, using my brain to figure out new trends before they happen. And thirdly, going against the grain by buying out of favor and over-sold companies that are fundamentally sound. My investment history shows that I have stayed consistent with my investment principles and strategies even when the market is in turmoil. Although market crashes make for very scary times, they have worked to my advantage.
