slug         | investment-income-tax-rates
content      | This is in response to a question from one of my clients regarding what to do about Appleâ€™s dividend income.&nbsp;<br><br>Before 2013 qualified dividends and long-term capital gains were taxed at 15% for federal tax purposes. Now for 2013 there is a new tax rate of 20%.&nbsp; Also beginning in 2013, there is a new net investment income tax with a rate of 3.8%.&nbsp; And for dessert, we have the Pease limit which adds about 1% more.&nbsp; 2012 qualified dividends and long-term capital gains were taxed at 15%. The same income items for 2013 could be taxed at about 25% depending on your situation!!!<br><br>Please allow me to run some tax bracket numbers by you.&nbsp; These numbers apply to SINGLE taxpayers only:<br><b><br>\r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +
